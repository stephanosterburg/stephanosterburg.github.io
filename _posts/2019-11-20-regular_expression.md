From [docs.python: re](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html):

>A regular expression (or RE) specifies a set of strings that matches it; the functions in this module let you check if a particular string matches a given regular expression

---

This post gives an overview and examples of regular expression syntax as implemented by the re built-in module (Python 3.7+). Assume ASCII character set unless otherwise specified. This post is an excerpt from the book [Python re(gex)?](https://github.com/learnbyexample/py_regular_expressions) by Sundeep Agarwal.

(_The above diagram was created using [Regulex](https://jex.im/regulex)._)

### Elements that define a regular expression

| Anchors | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `\A`    | restricts the match to start of string |
| `\Z `   | restricts the match to end of string |
| `^`     | restricts the match to start of line |
| `$`     | restricts the match to end of line |
| `\n`    | newline character is used as line separator |
| `\b`    | restricts the match to start/end of words |
| `word`  | characters: alphabets, digits, underscore |
| `\B`    | matches wherever `\b` doesn't match |

`^`, `$` and `\` are metacharacters in the above table, as these characters have special meaning. Prefix a `\` character to remove the special meaning and match such characters literally. For example, `\^` will match a `^` character instead of acting as an anchor.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `|`	    | multiple RE combined as conditional OR |
|           | each alternative can have independent anchors |
| `(pat)`	| group pattern(s), also a capturing group, i.e.: a(b\|c)d is same as abd\|acd |
| `(?:pat)` | non-capturing group |
| `(?P<name>pat)`	| named capture group |
| `.`	    | Match any character except the newline character `\n` |
| `[]`      | Character class, matches one character among many |

| Greedy Quantifiers | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| `*`	             | Match zero or more times |
| `+`	             | Match one or more times |
| `?`	             | Match zero or one times |
| `{m,n}`	         | Match `m` to `n` times (inclusive) |
| `{m,}`	         | Match at least m times |
| `{,n}`	         | Match up to `n` times (including 0 times) |
| `{n}`	             | Match exactly `n` times |
| `pat1.*pat2`       | any number of characters between `pat1` and `pat2` |
| `pat1.*pat2|pat2.*pat1` | match both `pat1` and `pat2` in any order |

Greedy here means that the above quantifiers will match as much as possible that'll also honor the overall RE. Appending a `?` to greedy quantifiers makes them non-greedy, i.e. match as minimally as possible. Quantifiers can be applied to literal characters, groups, backreferences and character classes.

| Character class | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `[aeiou]`  | Match any vowel |
| `[^aeiou]` | `^` inverts selection, so this matches any consonant |
| `[a-f]`    | `-` defines a range, so this matches any of abcdef characters |
| `\d`       | Match a digit, same as `[0-9]` |
| `\D`       | Match non-digit, same as `[^0-9]` or `[^\d]` |
| `\w`       | Match word character, same as `[a-zA-Z0-9_]` |
| `\W`       | Match non-word character, same as `[^a-zA-Z0-9_]` or `[^\w]` |
| `\s`       | Match whitespace character, same as `[\ \t\n\r\f\v]` |
| `\S`       | Match non-whitespace character, same as `[^\ \t\n\r\f\v]` or `[^\s]` |

| Lookarounds   | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `lookarounds` | custom assertions, zero-width like anchors |
| `(?!pat)`     | negative lookahead assertion |
| `(?<!pat)`    | negative lookbehind assertion |
| `(?=pat)`     | positive lookahead assertion |
| `(?<=pat)`    | positive lookbehind assertion |
| `(?!pat1)(?=pat2)` | multiple assertions can be specified in any order |
|               | as they mark a matching location without consuming characters |
| `((?!pat).)*` | Negate a grouping, similar to negated character class |

| Flags                     | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| `re.IGNORECASE` or `re.I` | flag to ignore case |
| `re.DOTALL` or `re.S`     | allow `.` metacharacter to match newline character |
| `flags=re.S|re.I `        | multiple flags can be combined using `|` operator |
| `re.MULTILINE` or `re.M`  | allow ^ and $ anchors to match line wise |
| `re.VERBOSE` or `re.X`    | allows to use literal whitespaces for aligning purposes |
|                           | and to add comments after the `#` character |
|                           | escape spaces and # if needed as part of actual RE |
| `re.ASCII` or `re.A`      | match only ASCII characters for `\b`, `\w`, `\d`, `\s` |
|                           | and their opposites, applicable only for Unicode patterns |
| `re.LOCALE` or `re.L`	    | use locale settings for byte patterns and 8-bit locales |
| `(?#comment)`	            | another way to add comments, not a flag |
| `(?flags:pat)`            | inline flags only for this pat, overrides `flags` argument |
|                           | flags is `i` for `re.I`, s for `re.S`, etc, except `L` for `re.L` |
| `(?-flags:pat)`           | negate flags only for this `pat` |
| `(?flags-flags:pat)`      | apply and negate particular flags only for this `pat` |
| `(?flags)`                | apply flags for whole RE, can be used only at start of RE |
|                           | anchors if any, should be specified after these flags |

| Matched portion   | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `re.Match` object | details like matched portions, location, etc |
| `m[0]` or `m.group(0)` | entire matched portion of `re.Match` object `m` |
| `m[n]` or `m.group(n)` | matched portion of nth capture group |
| `m.groups()`      | tuple of all the capture groups' matched portions |
| `m.span()`        | start and end+1 index of entire matched portion |
|                   | pass a number to get span of that particular capture group |
| `\N`              | backreference, gives matched portion of Nth capture group |
|                   | applies to both search and replacement sections |
|                   | possible values: `\1`, `\2` up to `\99` provided no more digits |
| `\g<N>`           | backreference, gives matched portion of Nth capture group |
|                   | possible values: `\g<0>`, `\g<1>`, etc (not limited to 99) |
|                   | `\g<0>` refers to entire matched portion |
| `(?P<name>pat)`   | named capture group |
|                   | refer as `'name'` in `re.Match` object |
|                   | refer as `(?P=name)` in search section |
|                   | refer as `\g<name>` in replacement section |


`\0` and `\100` onwards are considered as octal values, hence cannot be used as backreferences.

### Functions to match/extract patterns

| Function      | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `re.search`   | Check if given pattern is present anywhere in input string |
|               | Output is a `re.Match` object, usable in conditional expressions |
|               | r-strings preferred to define RE |
|               | Use byte pattern for byte input |
|               | Python also maintains a small cache of recent RE |
| `re.compile`  | Compile a pattern for reuse, outputs `re.Pattern` object |
| `re.sub`      | search and replace |
| `re.sub(r'pat', f, s)` | function `f` with `re.Match` object as argument |
| `re.escape`   | automatically escape all metacharacters |
| `re.split`    | split a string based on RE |
| `re.findall`  | returns all the matches as a list |
|               | if 1 capture group is used, only its matches are returned |
|               | 1+, each element will be tuple of capture groups |
| `re.finditer` | iterator with `re.Match` object for each match |
| `re.subn`     | gives tuple of modified string and number of substitutions |

The function definitions are given below:

```python
re.search(pattern, string, flags=0)
re.compile(pattern, flags=0)
re.sub(pattern, repl, string, count=0, flags=0)
re.escape(pattern)
re.split(pattern, string, maxsplit=0, flags=0)
re.findall(pattern, string, flags=0)
re.finditer(pattern, string, flags=0)
re.subn(pattern, repl, string, count=0, flags=0)
```

### Regular expression examples

As a good practice, always use raw strings to construct RE, unless other formats are required. This will avoid clash of special meaning of backslash character between RE and normal quoted strings.

* examples for `re.search`

```python
>>> sentence = 'This is a sample string'

# need to load the re module before use
>>> import re
# check if 'sentence' contains the pattern described by RE argument
>>> bool(re.search(r'is', sentence))
True
# ignore case while searching for a match
>>> bool(re.search(r'this', sentence, flags=re.I))
True
>>> bool(re.search(r'xyz', sentence))
False

# re.search output can be directly used in conditional expressions
>>> if re.search(r'ring', sentence):
...     print('mission success')
...
mission success

# use raw byte strings if input is of byte data type
>>> bool(re.search(rb'is', b'This is a sample string'))
True
```

* difference between string and line anchors

```python
# string anchors
>>> bool(re.search(r'\Ahi', 'hi hello\ntop spot'))
True
>>> words = ['surrender', 'unicorn', 'newer', 'door', 'empty', 'eel', 'pest']
>>> [w for w in words if re.search(r'er\Z', w)]
['surrender', 'newer']

# line anchors
>>> bool(re.search(r'^par$', 'spare\npar\ndare', flags=re.M))
True```

* examples for `re.findall`

```pyython
# match whole word par with optional s at start and optional e at end
>>> re.findall(r'\bs?pare?\b', 'par spar apparent spare part pare')
['par', 'spar', 'spare', 'pare']

# numbers >= 100 with optional leading zeros
>>> re.findall(r'\b0*[1-9]\d{2,}\b', '0501 035 154 12 26 98234')
['0501', '154', '98234']

# if multiple capturing groups are used, each element of output
# will be a tuple of strings of all the capture groups
>>> re.findall(r'(x*):(y*)', 'xx:yyy x: x:yy :y')
[('xx', 'yyy'), ('x', ''), ('x', 'yy'), ('', 'y')]

# normal capture group will hinder ability to get whole match
# non-capturing group to the rescue
>>> re.findall(r'\b\w*(?:st|in)\b', 'cost akin more east run against')
['cost', 'akin', 'east', 'against']

# useful for debugging purposes as well before applying substitution
>>> re.findall(r't.*?a', 'that is quite a fabricated tale')
['tha', 't is quite a', 'ted ta']
```

* examples for `re.split`

```python
# split based on one or more digit characters
>>> re.split(r'\d+', 'Sample123string42with777numbers')
['Sample', 'string', 'with', 'numbers']

# split based on digit or whitespace characters
>>> re.split(r'[\d\s]+', '**1\f2\n3star\t7 77\r**')
['**', 'star', '**']

# to include the matching delimiter strings as well in the output
>>> re.split(r'(\d+)', 'Sample123string42with777numbers')
['Sample', '123', 'string', '42', 'with', '777', 'numbers']

# use non-capturing group if capturing is not needed
>>> re.split(r'hand(?:y|ful)', '123handed42handy777handful500')
['123handed42', '777', '500']
```

* backreferencing within search pattern

```python
# whole words that have at least one consecutive repeated character
>>> words = ['effort', 'flee', 'facade', 'oddball', 'rat', 'tool']

>>> [w for w in words if re.search(r'\b\w*(\w)\1\w*\b', w)]
['effort', 'flee', 'oddball', 'tool']
working with matched portions
>>> re.search(r'b.*d', 'abc ac adc abbbc')
<re.Match object; span=(1, 9), match='bc ac ad'>
# retrieving entire matched portion, note the use of [0]
>>> re.search(r'b.*d', 'abc ac adc abbbc')[0]
'bc ac ad'

# capture group example
>>> m = re.search(r'a(.*)d(.*a)', 'abc ac adc abbbc')
# to get matched portion of second capture group
>>> m[2]
'c a'
# to get a tuple of all the capture groups
>>> m.groups()
('bc ac a', 'c a')
```

* examples for `re.finditer`

```python
# numbers < 350
>>> m_iter = re.finditer(r'\d+', '45 349 651 593 4 204')
>>> [m[0] for m in m_iter if int(m[0]) < 350]
['45', '349', '4', '204']

# start and end+1 index of each matching portion
>>> m_iter = re.finditer(r'ab+c', 'abc ac adc abbbc')
>>> for m in m_iter:
...     print(m.span())
...
(0, 3)
(11, 16)
examples for re.sub
>>> ip_lines = "catapults\nconcatenate\ncat"
>>> print(re.sub(r'^', r'* ', ip_lines, flags=re.M))
* catapults
* concatenate
* cat

# replace 'par' only at start of word
>>> re.sub(r'\bpar', r'X', 'par spar apparent spare part')
'X spar apparent spare Xt'

# same as: r'part|parrot|parent'
>>> re.sub(r'par(en|ro)?t', r'X', 'par part parrot parent')
'par X X X'

# remove first two columns where : is delimiter
>>> re.sub(r'\A([^:]+:){2}', r'', 'foo:123:bar:baz', count=1)
'bar:baz'
```

* backreferencing in replacement section

```python
# remove any number of consecutive duplicate words separated by space
>>> re.sub(r'\b(\w+)( \1)+\b', r'\1', 'aa a a a 42 f_1 f_1 f_13.14')
'aa a 42 f_1 f_13.14'

# add something around the matched strings
>>> re.sub(r'\d+', r'(\g<0>0)', '52 apples and 31 mangoes')
'(520) apples and (310) mangoes'

# swap words that are separated by a comma
>>> re.sub(r'(\w+),(\w+)', r'\2,\1', 'good,bad 42,24')
'bad,good 24,42'
```

* using functions in replacement section of `re.sub`

```python
>>> from math import factorial
>>> numbers = '1 2 3 4 5'
>>> def fact_num(n):
...     return str(factorial(int(n[0])))
...
>>> re.sub(r'\d+', fact_num, numbers)
'1 2 6 24 120'

# using lambda
>>> re.sub(r'\d+', lambda m: str(factorial(int(m[0]))), numbers)
'1 2 6 24 120'
```

* examples for lookarounds

```python
# change 'foo' only if it is not followed by a digit character
# note that end of string satisfies the given assertion
# 'foofoo' has two matches as the assertion doesn't consume characters
>>> re.sub(r'foo(?!\d)', r'baz', 'hey food! foo42 foot5 foofoo')
'hey bazd! foo42 bazt5 bazbaz'

# change whole word only if it is not preceded by : or -
>>> re.sub(r'(?<![:-])\b\w+\b', r'X', ':cart <apple -rest ;tea')
':cart <X -rest ;X'

# extract digits only if it is preceded by - and followed by ; or :
>>> re.findall(r'(?<=-)\d+(?=[:;])', '42 foo-5, baz3; x-83, y-20: f12')
['20']

# words containing all lowercase vowels in any order
>>> words = ['sequoia', 'subtle', 'questionable', 'exhibit', 'equation']
>>> [w for w in words if re.search(r'(?=.*a)(?=.*e)(?=.*i)(?=.*o).*u', w)]
['sequoia', 'questionable', 'equation']

# match if 'do' is not there between 'at' and 'par'
>>> bool(re.search(r'at((?!do).)*par', 'fox,cat,dog,parrot'))
False
# match if 'go' is not there between 'at' and 'par'
>>> bool(re.search(r'at((?!go).)*par', 'fox,cat,dog,parrot'))
True
```

* examples for `re.compile`

Regular expressions can be compiled using re.compile function, which gives back a re.Pattern object. The top level re module functions are all available as methods for this object. Compiling a regular expression helps if the RE has to be used in multiple places or called upon multiple times inside a loop (speed benefit). By default, Python maintains a small list of recently used RE, so the speed benefit doesn't apply for trivial use cases.

```python
>>> pet = re.compile(r'dog')
>>> bool(pet.search('They bought a dog'))
True
>>> bool(pet.search('A cat crossed their path'))
False

>>> remove_parentheses = re.compile(r'\([^)]*\)')
>>> remove_parentheses.sub('', 'a+b(addition) - foo() + c%d(#modulo)')
'a+b - foo + c%d'
>>> remove_parentheses.sub('', 'Hi there(greeting). Nice day(a(b)')
'Hi there. Nice day'
```
