Marc Randolph's (CEO of Netflix) father gave him a handwritten list of instructions when he was fresh out of college and about to start his first job at age 20.

Here are his rules:

+ Do at least 10 percent more than you are asked.
+ Never, ever, to anybody present as fact opinions on things you don't know. Takes great care and discipline.
+ Be courteous and considerate always -- up and down.
+ Don't knock, don't complain -- stick to constructive, serious criticism.
+ Don't be afraid to make decisions when you have the facts on which to make them.
+ Quantify where possible.
+ Be open-minded but skeptical.
+ Be prompt.
