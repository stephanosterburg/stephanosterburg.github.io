> Go into the arts. I'm not kidding. The arts are not a way to make a living. They are a very human way of making life more bearable. Practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow, for heaven's sake. Sing in the shower. Dance to the radio. Tell stories. Write a poem to a friend, even a lousy poem. Do it as well as you possibly can. You will get an enormous reward. You will have created something. ~ Kurt Vonnegut


So, what has that to do with coding and machine learning, you might ask. Well, for me, a lot. For more than 30 years, I worked in computer graphics, and coding was always the critical tool in my tool chest to make the "impossible" possible whether it was for TV commercials or film, or just for my projects.

Why machine learning? It is just another tool in the toolbox. Simple as that. Other use pen and paper, I use a computer and code to do art. Or animation, games, visual effects for cinema.
