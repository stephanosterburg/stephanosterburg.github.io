Building pipeline tools in the past - at least for me - involved dealing with [Qt](https://www.qt.io/). Qt's slogan is `One framework. One codebase. Any platform.`, but ...

So why `electron`? Electron is an open-source project maintained by [GitHub](https://github.com/) and based on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home). Because it uses web technologies, you can build desktop applications with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which means it works cross-platform on Mac, Windows, and Linux.

Instead of always "re-inventing" the wheel, we can take advantage of all sorts of open-source libraries, packages, and tools. A lot of them are listed at [electronjs.org](https://electronjs.org/community) or can be found [here](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-electron).


Here is an excellent write-up by [Jessica Lord](http://jlord.us/):

## <a name="#what-is-electron"></a> What is Electron?

Electron is a <span class="def">library</span> you can use to build desktop applications with <span class="def">JavaScript, HTML and CSS</span>. These applications can be packaged to run on Mac, Windows and Linux computers as well as be placed in the Mac and Windows app stores.

##### Next: [Why is this important?](#why-is-this-important)

### Definitions:

*   **JavaScript, HTML and CSS** Are web languages, meaning they are the building blocks of websites and browsers like Chrome know how to turn this code into the visual graphics you see.
*   **Electron is a library** Electron is code that you can re-use and not have to write yourself. You use it to build your project on top of it.

### Resources:

*   [Apps built on Electron](http://electron.atom.io/apps)
*   [Electron API Demos](http://electron.atom.io/#get-started) (see what you can do with Electron)

## <a name="#why-is-this-important"></a> Why is this important?

Typically, desktop applications for each operating system are written in each's <span class="def">native language</span>. That can mean having three teams writing three versions of your app. Electron enables you to write your app once and with web languages.

##### Next: [How, even?](#how-even)

### Definitions:

*   **native (operating system) language** These are languages that the major operating systems are (mostly) built with: Mac, Objective C, Linux, C; Windows, C++.

## <a name="#how-even"></a> How, even?

Electron combines <span class="def">Chromium</span> and <span class="def">Node.js</span> with a set of custom <span class="def">APIs</span> for native operating system functions like open file dialogs, notifications, icons and more.

##### Next: [What is developing like?](#what-s-developing-like)

### Definitions:

*   **API** Application Program Interface describes the set of functions made available for you to use a library with.
*   **Chromium** Created by Google, this is the open-source library used by Google's browser Chrome.
*   **Node.js** (or Node) A tool for writing JavaScript on servers, accessing filesystems, and networks (your computer is also a server!).

## <a name="#what-s-developing-like"></a> What's developing like?

Developing with Electron is like building web pages that you can seamlessly <span class="def">use Node in</span>—or building a Node app in which you can build an interface with HTML and CSS. And you only need to design for <span class="def">one browser</span>, the <span class="def">latest Chrome</span>.

##### Next: [Prereqs](#prereqs)

### Definitions:

*   **Use Node in** That's not all! In addition to the full Node API everywhere, you can make use of the over 300,000 modules already written and hosted on npm, a package manager for Node.
*   **One browser** Not all browsers are the same, and web designers and developers often have to go the extra mile to make one site look the same on each.
*   **Latest Chrome** Use over 90% of ES2015, the latest updates to JavaScript, as well as cool features like CSS Variables.

Since Electron's two components are websites and JavaScript, you'll need experience in both of those before you begin. Check out some tutorials on HTML, CSS, and JS and install Node on your computer.

*   **Let's be real**, learning to make websites and write Node are not overnight things, but hopefully, the links below can get you started.

## <a name="#two-processes"></a> Two Processes

Electron has two types of processes: Main and Renderer. There are <span class="def">modules</span> that work on each or in both of the processes. The main process is more behind-the-scenes, while the renderer process is each of the windows in your app.

### Definitions:

*   **Modules** Electron's APIs are grouped based on what they do. For instance, the `dialog` module has all the APIs for native dialogs like open file, save the file, and alerts.

##### Next: [Main Process](#main-process)

### Resources:

*   [Electron APIs List](http://electron.atom.io/docs/api/)

## <a name="#main-process"></a> Main Process

The main process, commonly a file named `main.js,` is the entry point to every Electron app. It controls the life of the app, from open to close. It also <span class="def">calls the native elements</span> and creates each new renderer process in the app. The full Node API is built-in.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![Content by URL Count]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/posts/2019/electron_main.png)
{: refdef}

### Definitions:

*   **Calls the native elements** Opening dialogs and other native operating system interactions are resource-intensive, so it's done in the main process, leaving the renderer process uninterrupted.

##### Next: [Renderer Process](#renderer-process)

### Resources:

*   [Electron APIs List](http://electron.atom.io/docs/api/)

---
## <a name="#renderer-process"></a> Renderer Process

The renderer process is a browser window in your app. Unlike the main process, there can be multiple of these and <span class="def">each is independent</span>. They can also be <span class="def">hidden</span>. Usually, one is named `index.html.` They're like typical HTML files, but in Electron you've got the whole Node API available here, too, unlike any web browser.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![Content by URL Count]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/posts/2019/electron_renderer.png)
{: refdef}

### Definitions:

*   **Each is independent** every renderer process is a separate process, meaning a crash in one won't affect another.
*   **Hidden** You can set a window to be hidden and use it to execute code in the background.

## <a name="#think-of-it-like-this"></a> Think of it like this

In Chrome (or another web browser), each tab and its web page is like a single renderer process in Electron. If you close all of the tabs, Chrome is still there, this is like your primary process, and you can open a new window or quit the app.

##### Next: [Stay in touch](#stay-in-touch)

## <a name="#stay-in-touch"></a> Stay in touch

The main and renderer processes need to be able to communicate since they're both responsible for different tasks. For that there's <span class="def">IPC</span>, interprocess communication. Use it to pass messages between main and renderer processes.

{: refdef}

### Definitions:

*   **IPC** The main process and renderer process each has an IPC module to use.

##### Next: [Put it all together](#put-it-all-together)

---
## <a name="#put-it-all-together"></a> Put it all together

Electron apps are like Node apps and use a <span class="def">`package.json` file</span>. It's there that you define which file is your main process and thus where Electron should start your app. Then that main process can create renderer processes, and you'll use IPC to pass messages between the two.

### Definitions:

*   **`package.json` file** This is a common file in Node apps that contains metadata about the project and a list of dependencies.

##### Next: [Quick start](#quick-start)

## <a name="#quick-start"></a> Quick start

The Electron Quick Start repository is a bare-bones Electron app with the `package.json,` `main.js,` and `index.html` you've learned about here—a great place to get started! Also, check out the boilerplates for templates with your framework of choice.

## <a name="#packaging"></a> Packaging

Once your app is built, you can package it with the <span class="def">command-line tool</span> `electron-packager` for Mac, Windows or Linux. Add scripts for this to your `package.json.` Check out resources below for getting your app in the Mac and Windows app stores.
