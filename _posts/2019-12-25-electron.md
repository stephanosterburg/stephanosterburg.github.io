Building pipeline tools in the past - at least for me - involved dealing with [Qt](https://www.qt.io/). Qt's slogan is `One framework. One codebase. Any platform.`, but ...

So why `electron`? Electron is an open-source project maintained by [GitHub](https://github.com/) and based on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home). Because it uses web technologies, you can build desktop applications with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which means it works cross-platform on Mac, Windows, and Linux.

Instead of constantly "re-inventing" the wheel, we can take advantage of all sorts of open-source libraries, packages, and tools. A lot of them are listed at [electronjs.org](https://electronjs.org/community) or can be found [here](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-electron).
