### Houdini

To stay up-to-date, I decided to work through a course offered by [The VFX School](https://thevfxschool.com/) using [Houdini 17.5 (Apprentice)](https://www.sidefx.com/products/houdini-apprentice/).

Other websites I used:
- [Applied Houdini](http://www.appliedhoudini.com/)
- [HoudiniTricks](https://houdinitricks.com/)
- [Entagma](http://www.entagma.com/)
