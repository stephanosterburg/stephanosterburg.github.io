## Hello,
I am a Machine Learning Engineer/Data Scientist and an accomplished digital production expert and computer artist, located in the San Francisco Bay Area. After some unfortunate events in our live I made the bold decision to change my career.
Why you might ask. Well, it's not like it fall out of the sky. No, I had always a fascination with data and visualization.
After taking a well deserved brake last year and been able to reflect on what I would like to do, I found Data Science. Since summer 2018, including six months at [Flatiron School](https://www.flatironschool.com/), I am full gas on the quest to discover the world of data and worked relentlessly to gain all the necessary knowledge, and expertise one needs as a Data Scientist.
I enjoy a challenging, progressive environment that offers room to innovate.

My experience and knowledge include:

* Overseeing a team on numerous animated feature film productions.
* Serving in a wide range of technical and creative positions, ranging from software engineer to VFX and CG Supervisor.
* Identifying opportunities for improvements and proposing realistic changes to streamline workflow processes and decrease production delays.
* Data Science projects include analyzing news content of its authenticity, forest cover type classification and image classification etcetera.
* Python, Pandas, Numpy, dask, keras/tensorflow, sklearn, Machine Learning, Deep Learning etcetera.
