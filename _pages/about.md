<h5> TL;DR </h5>

<p>
    I am <b>Stephan Osterburg</b>, located in the Bay Area - San Francisco, CA. I am a computer graphics veteran who is falling in love with data science.
</p>

<br><br>

<h5> Hello, </h5>

<p>I am <b>Stephan Osterburg</b>, a Data Scientist and an accomplished digital production expert and computer artist, located in the San Francisco Bay Area. After some unfortunate events in our live I made the bold decision to change my career.
<br>
Why you might ask. Well, it's not like it fall out of the sky. No, I had always a fascination with data and visualization.
<br>
After taking a well deserved brake last year and been able to reflect on what I would like to do, I found Data Science. Since summer 2018, including six months at <a href="https://flatironschool.com/">Flatiron School</a>, I am full gas on the quest to discover the world of data and worked relentlessly to gain all the necessary knowledge, and expertise one needs as a Data Scientist.
<br>
I enjoy a challenging, progressive environment that offers room to innovate.
<br>
<br>
My experience and knowledge include:
    <ul type="circle">
    <li>Overseeing a team on numerous animated feature film productions.</li>
    <li>Serving in a wide range of technical and creative positions, ranging from software engineer to VFX and CG Supervisor.</li>
    <li>Identifying opportunities for improvements and proposing realistic changes to streamline workflow processes and decrease production delays.</li>
    <li>Data Science projects include analyzing news content of its authenticity, forest cover type classification and image classification etcetera.</li>
    <li>Python, Pandas, Numpy, dask, keras/tensorflow, sklearn, Machine Learning, Deep Learning etcetera.</li>
    </ul>
